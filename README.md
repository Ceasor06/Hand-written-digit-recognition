## This work presents the handwritten digit recognition using supervised learning methods, more precisely Support Vector Machine (SVM).


Handwriting recognition, also known as Handwritten Text Recognition, is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, touch screens and other devices. 

Many current systems use ***Discrete Hidden Markov Vision***-based model or combination of ***Neural Network (NN)*** and ***Hidden Markov Model
(HMM)*** for recognition. In this project, we will use SVM; Support Vector Machine. Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.
